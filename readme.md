# Android NDK

Working with C/C++ & Java.

Imagine we have a `.so` file built w/ C/C++ and we want to use it in our Android app. We use NDK as a bridge to make this conversation happen.

In this project we are returning a string from a C method, and also calling a sum method passing 2 numbers as parameters.
